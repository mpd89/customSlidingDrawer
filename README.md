customSlidingDrawer
Author: Michael Dempsey

===================

This is a customizable sliding drawer widget for Android applications. The Android SDK sliding drawer widget
was deprecated, and it offered very limited functionality. My widget works for Android 2.2 and above, and allows the 
developer to decide on how the drawer should interact with the users gestures including fling, drag, and tap.

The drawer allows the developer to:

1.) Decide where the drawer should stop on the users screen based on screen percentage. 

2.) How many stop points the drawer should have.

3.) The velocity threshold for fling gestures. 

4.) The drag decision points for which stop point the drawer should animate to if the user drags it out. 

5.) Decide what the contents of the drawer should be. (A listview based button layout is the default)
